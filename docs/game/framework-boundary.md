# Framework / feature boundary

Boil is two layers: a **framework** (reusable infrastructure) and the **features**
built on top of it. The framework ships *empty* — zero features, not even the
"basic" ones (PlayerData, Settings, UIShell are all features). This split is what
lets an existing project pull a newer framework without re-merging its features.

## What's framework, what's a feature

| Layer | Lives in | Owns |
| ----- | -------- | ---- |
| **Framework** | `src/shared/`, `src/client/`, `src/server/`, `tools/` | The mechanism: the UI kit + seams, the load helpers, the presentation registry, the splitter, the lints, the entry scripts. |
| **Feature** | `src/features/<Name>/` | Content: one self-contained, removable unit. Everything else is built out of these. |
| **Skin** | `src/skins/<Name>/` | Content: one look, implementing the component contract. Installed by `boil`, discovered by the skin registry. |

The splitter (`tools/split`) and `tools/check-views` only ever touch
`src/features/`, so the physical boundary is already clean. A fresh framework is
this repo with `src/features/` empty — the entries, registries, and UI kit all
still load and the client still mounts.

## The contract: `Shared.Boil`

Features consume the framework through **one** module — `src/shared/Boil.luau` —
and nothing deeper:

```lua
local Boil = require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Boil)

React.createElement(Boil.ui.Button, { variant = "red", text = "X" })
Boil.UIRegistry.registerScreen("Notes", element)
local data = Boil.useReplica(...)
```

`Boil` exposes `ui`, `audio`, `Loader`, `LoadOrdered`, `UIRegistry`, and
`useReplica`, plus the skin-authoring **types** (`Boil.Skin`, `Boil.Components`,
`Boil.ButtonProps`, …) — a skin package has to name the shapes it implements, and
`Shared.ui.contract` is a deep path this rule forbids. Members load lazily on
first access, so requiring `Boil` is cheap and
realm-safe — a server Service that only touches `Boil.LoadOrdered` never pulls in
the React UI kit behind `Boil.ui`. It deliberately does **not** export third-party
Wally packages (React, ByteNet, ReplicaService — require those directly) or
anything a feature owns. Because features bind to this surface instead of deep
paths, the framework can refactor its internals freely; only this surface has to
stay stable. That's what turns a framework update into a version bump instead of a
merge conflict.

## The rule: the dependency arrow points one way

**Framework code must never name a feature.** Features depend on the framework;
the framework is agnostic to every feature. If the framework seems to need
something from a feature, the seam is backwards — the feature should *register
into* the framework, not the other way around.

- Touching the `Features` container generically is fine: iterating it,
  `LoadDescendants(Features, …)`, `Features:GetChildren()`. That names nobody.
- Reaching a *named* child is a violation: `Features:WaitForChild("UIShell")`,
  `require(ReplicatedStorage.Features.Notes)`, `Features.Settings`.

`tools/check-framework-boundary` enforces the boundary **both ways**: it scans the
runtime framework realms for any named-feature reference (this rule), *and* scans
the installable content dirs — `src/features` and `src/skins` — to ensure they
reach the framework only through `Shared.Boil`; a deep
`require(ReplicatedStorage.Shared.ui)` from either fails it. Run it alongside
`check-views`:

```
lune run tools/check-framework-boundary
```

(The build tools under `tools/` are generic Lune scripts that operate on the
features *directory* by design, so they're out of scope for the lint. A feature
requiring its own modules under `ReplicatedStorage.Features.<Self>` is fine.)

### Worked example: how UIShell stays optional

The client root needs *some* provider wrapping the tree for frame open/close
state — but it can't name `UIShell`, or the framework wouldn't boot empty. So the
registry carries it:

- `UIRegistry.registerProvider(component)` / `getProviders()` — a feature registers
  a top-level React provider to wrap the whole client tree.
- `src/features/UIShell/UIShellPresentation.client.luau` registers
  `UIShell.FrameProvider` at load (discovered before mount, like any presentation).
- `src/client/init.client.luau` composes whatever's registered around the root
  Frame. With **none** registered, the root still mounts.

Remove the `UIShell` folder → no provider registers → the framework boots fine
without it. A feature naming *itself* (the presentation requires `UIShell`) is
allowed; only *framework* code naming a feature is not.

## Updating the framework in an existing game

This is what the boundary buys you, and it's a command rather than a merge:

```bash
boil upgrade              # newest framework
boil upgrade --dry-run    # see what would change first
boil upgrade --ref=v0.4.0 # a specific release
```

It fetches the framework and **replaces the four paths in the table above** —
`src/shared/`, `src/client/`, `src/server/`, `tools/`. `src/features/` and
`src/skins/` are never read, let alone written: they're yours, and the one-way
dependency rule means the framework can't have opinions about them.

Replacement rather than merge is deliberate — a file the framework *deleted* has
to disappear, which a merge would happily keep. Three things it won't do blindly:

- **`default.project.json`** carries your project name, so it's compared and
  flagged, never overwritten. If a framework version adds a sync path (the way
  `Skins` was added), the warning is your cue to add it by hand.
- **`wally.toml`** only gains entries whose *name* is missing. A dependency you
  pinned to a different version is left alone.
- **A dirty working tree** stops the upgrade. Git is the undo button here — with
  a clean tree, `git diff` afterwards is an exact record of what the framework
  changed, and `git checkout .` reverts it. `--force` overrides.

Afterwards it prints the checks worth running: the boundary lint first, since a
framework change plus your features is exactly the combination it exists to
police.

### The framework version is not the CLI version

Two numbers, both called Boil, and they move independently:

| | Where it lives | What updates it |
| - | -------------- | --------------- |
| **Framework** | `boil.toml` → `[project] boil = "0.1.0"` | `boil upgrade` |
| **CLI** | the global npm install; `boil --version` | `npm i -g @encryptal/boil@latest` |

`boil upgrade` can only move the first one. Nothing inside a project can update
the tool doing the upgrading — so when a bug you're hitting was fixed in a newer
CLI, `boil upgrade` will honestly report the framework as up to date and leave
you no better off.

That's why `upgrade` and `doctor` both check npm for a newer CLI and say so
before doing anything else. The check is best-effort: offline, or with the
registry unreachable, it stays quiet rather than failing the command.

## Adding to the public surface

When the framework grows a genuinely shared capability that features should
consume, add it to `Boil` (and document it here). Resist exporting feature-owned
things or third-party packages — keep the surface small and stable, because every
symbol on it is a compatibility promise to every downstream project.
