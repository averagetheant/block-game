# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- **Rokit** — toolchain manager. Install from <https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit>.
- **Roblox Studio** with the Rojo plugin installed.

## Starting from scratch

If you're beginning a new game rather than working in this checkout:

```bash
npm install -g @encryptal/boil
boil new my-game && cd my-game
```

It asks for a name and whether you want the example features, then scaffolds the
framework, renames the project, and makes the first commit. Carry on with the
one-time setup below.

## One-time setup

```bash
rokit install   # reads rokit.toml, installs rojo, wally, lune
wally install   # reads wally.toml, populates Packages/
```

After `wally install`, `Packages/` will contain `React.lua`, `ReactRoblox.lua`, `Loader.lua`, and an `_Index/` folder with transitive dependencies.

**Re-run `wally install` whenever `wally.toml` or `wally.lock` changes** — after a
pull, after `boil add`, after anyone adds a dependency. `Packages/` is gitignored,
so the lockfile can name a package your checkout doesn't have on disk, and the
symptom is nastier than a missing file: `ReplicatedStorage.Packages` is a Rojo
`$path`, so the *only* thing that puts a package in Studio is having it on disk,
and a feature requiring the missing one throws inside the client entry's
presentation loop — which aborts the loop, so every presentation after it silently
never mounts. A single uninstalled dependency reads as "half the UI is gone".

Adding the module by hand in Studio doesn't fix it and can't: Rojo owns that
folder and removes anything it doesn't have a file for on the next sync, so the
manual copy disappears again on the next connect.

## Dev loop

If you have the CLI installed, one command runs both halves:

```bash
boil dev                 # splitter (watch) + rojo serve, output prefixed
boil dev --port=34872    # if the default Rojo port is taken
```

Ctrl-C stops both. `--no-split` / `--no-serve` run one half alone.

Or do it by hand, in two terminals:

```bash
# terminal 1 — regenerate build/ whenever a file under src/features/ changes
lune run tools/split -- --watch

# terminal 2 — serve the Rojo project to Studio
rojo serve
```

Both halves matter: skip the splitter and Studio syncs a stale `build/`, so
edits to `src/features/` appear to do nothing.

Then in Roblox Studio:

1. Open (or create) an empty place.
2. Click **Connect** in the Rojo plugin (default host/port).
3. File → Save (the place file is gitignored as `Boil.rbxlx`).

### One-shot build

```bash
lune run tools/split        # generate build/ once
rojo build -o Boil.rbxlx    # or --output Boil.rbxl
```

## Adding features and skins from the registry

The package CLI is an npm package, installed once per machine — not part of the
Rokit toolchain:

```bash
npm install -g @encryptal/boil
```

```bash
boil setup          # name the project, create/connect the index
boil explore        # browse the index and install from the list
boil add encryptal/shop
boil install        # restore everything after a fresh clone
```

`setup` is a one-time step per project — it creates the index repo on GitHub if
it doesn't exist yet (via the `gh` CLI or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) and points this
checkout at it.

Features land in `src/features/<Name>/`, skins in `src/skins/<Name>/`, both
vendored and committed. Run `wally install` afterwards if the install reported new
Wally dependencies, and read the Studio setup notes it prints — assets are still
yours to create. See [registry.md](registry.md).

## Verifying the scaffold

Run a Play test. Expected output:

- Server console: `[HealthService] started (priority=10)`
- Client UI: a full-screen `TextLabel` reading `HP: 100` (the React-mounted `HealthUI` component).

If either is missing, check:

- `Packages/` exists and contains `Loader.lua` — otherwise `wally install` hasn't run.
- `build/` exists and contains `shared/HealthSystem/init.luau` etc. — otherwise `lune run tools/split` hasn't run.
- The Rojo plugin reports no sync errors.

## Optional: let an AI drive Studio (Studio MCP)

By default an AI assistant only sees your code — it can't inspect Studio or Play-test. The [Roblox Studio MCP](https://github.com/Chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp) bridges your AI tool to a live Studio session, so it can find instances, read properties, run Luau, start/stop Play-tests, and capture the Script Profiler — i.e. verify its own work instead of relying on you to report back.

1. In Studio: **Game Settings → Security → Allow HTTP Requests** (on).
2. Add it to your AI tool (Claude Code shown; also works with Codex, Gemini, Claude Desktop):

   ```bash
   claude mcp add robloxstudio -- npx -y @chrrxs/robloxstudio-mcp@latest --auto-install-plugin
   ```

3. Restart the tool and open the place you want it to work in.

`CLAUDE.md` already adapts its guidance to whether these tools are connected. Check the MCP repo for current setup details.

## Regenerating the sourcemap

For Luau LSP / type inference:

```bash
rojo sourcemap --output sourcemap.json
```

`sourcemap.json` is gitignored; regenerate on demand.
